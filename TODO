List of TODO things:
	-rename control lines from the microsequencer. Some of them have really ugly names
	
	-In schematics: All active low in/outputs should either have a not in it's name, or a graphical bar above it
	
	-schematic bootstrapper/circuit tester
	-schematic ALU: use unconnected net's with a netname for the multiple connections of the A B and Y signals.
	-schematic CPU: error signals
	
	-create verilog simulation of usart_device
	
	-urom: reset instruction also resets program counter.
	
	-fix the mixing of printf and <<
	
	verilog sram module. there is almost no difference between abstract and discrete version. resolve this weirdness
	
	-adjust the ALU sim test to the new ALU
