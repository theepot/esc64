List of TODO things:
	-update all chip timings(transistion time should be added with propagation delay)
	-include gaurds of .v files should have consistent names
	-all .v files should have some header with general information and todo's
	-rename control lines from the microsequencer
	-memfile parameter of memory devices should have consistent names
	-remove delays from the non-structural models if they are not used in the structural-cpu anymore
	-rename ALU's signal fcin to s(tatus)r(register)cin
	-change the Makefile's of all the simulations so that source directories get included by -I<path>, and get rid including relative paths
	
	-All active low in/outputs should either have a not in it's name, or a graphical bar above it.
